# Hexastore

I've always been interested in how information is stored and retrieved. Inspired by a project of a friend (Levelgraph), I decided to research more about Hexastores and how they can be adapted to modern NoSQL databases such as LevelDB and Cassandra. Out of this fascination and curiosity I created Hexagon: a simple Python implementation of Hexastores backed by LevelDB.

### Educational use

This project is greatly educational and should not be used in production.
